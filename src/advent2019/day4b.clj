;;; Given an integer, break it into its constituent digits.  Convert to a
;;; string with `(str number)`, then use a nifty trick of ASCII codes (I think
;;; credit for this trick goes to whoever wrote a certain program in the
;;; user manual for the Commodore VIC-20; there was a similar trick there
;;; using ASCII math: subtract the ASCII value of the number in question
;;; from the ASCII value for \0 (which is 48), and you get the digit itself.
;;; For example, \5 has an ASCII value of 53; so when we calculate 53 minus
;;; 48, we get 5.

;;; The additional criterion for Part 2 is that there be two adjacent
;;; matching digits that are not part of a larger group of matching digits.
;;; The strategy we use to deal with this is to take the results from
;;; Part 1 (since Part 2 meets all the constraints of Part 1, but imposes
;;; an additional constraint), and then do the following: (i) convert all
;;; digits in a larger group of matching digits to "-" using a regex, so
;;; larger groups are removed from consideration (see `converted` below); (ii)
;;; delete all pairs of digits (see `deleted` below).  We then compare the
;;; length of strings of opertaion (i) and opertaion (ii); if they not the same
;;; length, there must have been a pair of digits that is not pat of a larger
;;; group.
