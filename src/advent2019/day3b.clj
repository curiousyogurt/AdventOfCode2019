;;; Produce a trail of breadcrums for one move.  Define move as a list with two
;;; elements: a direction, and a distance.  This is analogous to the convention
;;; in thet data.  So '("R" 8) means move right 8 units.
;;;
;;; The breadcrumbs are the sequence of coordinates that allsowm us to realise
;;; the path.  For example, [[2 0] [1 0] [0 0]] means that we started at '(0 0)
;;; and took 2 steps to the right (along the x axis).
;;;
;;; We can then call step to create a list of breadcrumbs recursively for the
;;; move in question.  So to extend the trail of breadcrumbs with crumbs
;;; [[0 0]] and move ["R" 2], we do a single move with [0 0] as our origin and
;;; "R" as our direction.  Step will return [1 0].  Then we recur, consing
;;; [1 0] to the breadcrumbs, and making our move ["R" 1].
;;;
